# Developer Portfolio

A modern one-page developer portfolio built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (v4), and Vite.  
This project serves as a personal website to showcase my projects, experience, and contact information in a clean and responsive layout.

---

## Tech Stack

- React – frontend framework for building dynamic interfaces  
- TypeScript – type-safe development  
- Tailwind CSS v4 – utility-first styling  
- Vite – fast development and build tool  

---

## Current Features

- Basic layout and reusable UI components (Button, Card, etc.)  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Tailwind setup with custom theme and utilities  

---

## Future Ideas

- Add animations and transitions using Framer Motion  
- Improve mobile and tablet responsiveness  
- Add detailed project cards with GitHub and live demo links  
- Include a downloadable resume section  
- Create a contact form with email integration (EmailJS or backend API)  
- Implement dark/light mode toggle  
- Add smooth scrolling and navigation between sections  
- Deploy on Vercel
